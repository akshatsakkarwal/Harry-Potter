                    Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
                    author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young
                    wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron
                    Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
                    and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against
                    Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal,
                    overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic
                    and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

                    The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the
                    United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All
                    versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1]
                    A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age
                    fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of
                    mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of
                    Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural
                    meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is
                    death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice,
                    corruption, and madness.[4]

                    Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the
                    Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense
                    popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They
                    have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and
                    are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult
                    literature.[5] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than
                    500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book
                    series in history, and have been translated into more than eighty
                    languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the
                    fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling
                    roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million
                    copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

                </a>
                <li>Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the
                    books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have
                    attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of
                    modern young adult literature.[5] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million
                    copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into
                    more than eighty languages.[6] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling
                    books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom
                    and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</li>
                <li>The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.
                    Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[7]
                    making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the
                    Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.</li>
                <li>The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous
                    derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London
                    that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new
                    information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with
                    Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions,
                    collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal
                    Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>The novels fall into the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify as a type of fantasy called "urban
                    fantasy", "contemporary fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly
                    serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and
                    black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the bildungsroman, or coming of age
                    novel,[8] and contain elements of mystery, adventure, horror, thriller, and romance. The books are
                    also, in the words of Stephen King, "shrewd mystery tales",[9] and each book is constructed in the
                    manner of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery adventure. The stories are told from a third person
                    limited point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of Philosopher's Stone,
                    Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half-Blood Prince).</li>

                <li>The series can be considered part of the British children's boarding school genre, which includes
                    Rudyard Kipling's Stalky & Co., Enid Blyton's Malory Towers, St. Clare's and the Naughtiest Girl
                    series, and Frank Richards's Billy Bunter novels: the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in
                    Hogwarts, a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of
                    magic.[10] In this sense they are "in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes's Tom Brown's
                    School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life", though they
                    are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding
                    school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss
                    of innocence in a 1990s British setting.[11][12]</li>
                <li>Each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry struggles with the problems
                    he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If
                    students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories
                    reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far
                    beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his
                    followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes a matter of life and death – a point underlined, as the
                    series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books.[21][22] In the
                    aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and
                    mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry
                    Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from
                    Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.[21]</li>
